                    <p class="card-text">Season 4 of "The Boys" is highly anticipated, promising more explosive developments and shocking twists. With Homelander's increasingly unstable behavior, his reign 
                        of terror is expected to pose significant threats. The vigilante group led by Billy Butcher will continue their fight against Vought International and the corrupt 
                        superheroes, with Starlight playing a crucial role due to her insider knowledge. Vought's corporate machinations will add to the intrigue, while the return of 
                        characters like Soldier Boy and the rise of Victoria Neuman will further complicate the dynamics. Maintaining its blend of dark satire, intense action, and social 
                        commentary, Season 4 will explore themes of power, corruption, and the moral ambiguities of heroism. Fans can expect more jaw-dropping moments and bold storytelling 
                        choices that push boundaries and challenge expectations.

                            Hey, my name is Param Singh Virdi. I'm an international student. I'm pursuing CPP(Computer Programming),  not that I love it but it's technical and skillful.
                            So, here is the info about The homelander - from "The Boys". Homelander, one of the central characters in the TV series "The Boys," is a complex and menacing 
                            figure who serves as the primary antagonist. Portrayed by Antony Starr, Homelander is the leader of the Seven, a group of superheroes managed by the powerful 
                            corporation Vought International. At first glance, he embodies the archetype of a superhero: strong, handsome, and charismatic. However, beneath his polished 
                            exterior lies a deeply flawed and dangerous individual.
                        <p>
                            Homelander's powers are immense, making him nearly invincible. He possesses superhuman strength, speed, flight, and laser vision, reminiscent of iconic superheroes 
                            like Superman. These abilities, combined with his public image as the world's greatest hero, make him a formidable force. Yet, it's his personality and actions 
                            that truly set him apart.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Raised in a laboratory by Vought, Homelander's upbringing lacked genuine human connection and moral guidance, leading to his narcissistic and sociopathic tendencies. 
                            He craves adoration and control, often resorting to extreme measures to maintain his image and assert dominance. His disregard for human life and his manipulative 
                            nature are evident in his interactions with both allies and enemies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Throughout "The Boys," Homelander's actions reveal the dark side of unchecked power. He is ruthless in dealing with threats to his authority, whether they come 
                            from rebellious members of the Seven or external adversaries. His relationship with Madelyn Stillwell, a Vought executive, highlights his need for maternal 
                            approval and control, further complicating his character. Homelander's public persona contrasts sharply with his private behavior. While he projects an image of 
                            heroism and benevolence, he is responsible for numerous atrocities, including the plane crash incident where he chooses not to save the passengers to avoid damaging 
                            his reputation. This duality makes him a captivating and terrifying character, as viewers witness the consequences of his actions and the fear he instills in those around him.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In essence, Homelander is a critique of the superhero archetype, exploring the potential dangers of absolute power and the corruption that can arise from it. 
                            His character serves as a reminder that heroes, too, can be deeply flawed, and the line between heroism and villainy can be perilously thin.
